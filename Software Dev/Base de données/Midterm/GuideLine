Objectives for unemployment data: 

- How has the unemployment evolved trhoughout the last 20 years. Taking 5 years and see evolutions 
- Does a state match the evolution of the US employment rates? 
- Compare total employment against 
- Does the month influence employment rates ?
- Does the state influence employment rates ? 

What is the difference between the groups? 
What is happening over time? 
How are two variables related? 
What are the "Top 10"? What are the "Bottom 10"?
What summary statistics could you calculate? Mean? Median? Min? Max? Variance?


What I need to do: 

I want a mean table for each year instead of having data for each month

setosa_data %>%
  arrange(-Sepal.Length)%>%
  kbl(digits = 2, 
      col.names = c("Sepal Length","Sepal Withd", "Petal Length", "Petal Withd"),
